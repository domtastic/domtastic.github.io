				<p>We drove up the road just below 3,000 ft. to the summit so it would be an official climb.  We got lucky as it started to rain right after we set up the tent.  We had a couple beers, Mike smoked a bowl, and we argued who's tent Denali would sleep in to keep us warm.  It was a cold night, but the nalgene with boiled water kept me nice and warm.  We woke up early, packed up our tents and hit the road.
				</p>

				<p>The first section of the hike is just up the road until you hit the trail.  The sunrise was incredibly red, and the pictures we took don't do it justice.  It started snowing as soon as we got on the trail and the coulds were constricting - they would give until our way down. The hike to the top was cold, windy, and icy while we broke trail.  The summit was no different.  Denali crushed it all the way to the top and recieved a large handful of Old Trapper beef jerkey as a reward.
				</p>

				<p>After many attempts at a summit selfie, we staterted to make our way down the mountain. We finally catch a break in the clouds and the views are breathtaking - snow capped peaks and golden aspens. The Sawatch Range never disappoints. We make it back down to the car and Denali is pooped.  We hit up Eddyline Brewery for a much needed beer and pizza, and say farewell, until next time.
